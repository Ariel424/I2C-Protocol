# I2C-Protocol
Implementation of an I2C multi-device bus, including start/stop conditions, arbitration handling, and acknowledgment logic. The RTL is written in Verilog and paired with a SystemVerilog/UVM verification setup tailored to validate edge cases and multi-master interactions. This project highlights robust bus behavior, scalable testbench structure, and applicability to FPGA-based communication systems.
